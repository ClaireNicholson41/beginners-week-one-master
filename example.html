  <p>
    I am currently learning to code with
    <a href= https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/>Code First Girls<a/>
      . Going over everything from how the internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks! Everyone should learn code, here are some pretty good reasons why...
  </p>

  <ol>
     <li>You can understand what is going on 'under the hood'</li>
     <li>Not have to rely on someone else for a quick prototype website!</li>
     <li>It's fun!</li>
   </ol>

  <h2>
    <strong><em>What do you need to create a website?</em></strong>
  </h2>

  <p>
  Not much!
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
    <li>A text editor (I am using Atom)</li>
    <li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
    <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
  </ul>
